# STAT31190_Python_Scripts
Python scripts for STAT31190, Fast Algorithms

A couple of Professor Hoskin's scripts translated into Python. Should only need numpy and matplotlib for now, may add a Christoffel-Darboux implementation if I can get fortran cdgqf working...

Will add more comments if people are interested
